Following opcodes in an instruction set, the user is tasked with using these instructions to find values given at the end of execution. 

The first puzzle revolves around using your instruction set with a slight modification of value1 = 12 and value2 = 2, then running the program until it reaches the exit opcode and submitting the value at place 0.

The second puzzle uses a solution to find the necessary noun and verb to reach that answer (value1 = noun, value2 = verb). The values that give the solution are between 0 and 99 and the user must check all of them to find the correct set.
